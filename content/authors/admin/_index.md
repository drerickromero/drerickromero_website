Erick Romero's research focus was phononics and nanomechanical systems, which aimed to develop a circuitry platform based on mechanical vibrations. By engineering the acoustic field interactions with nanomechanical systems, Erick has been able to integrate some circuitry capabilities in a silicon chip, just as an electronic circuit but with phonons.

He currently works at the Australian National Fabrication Facility supporting technical fabrications processes.
