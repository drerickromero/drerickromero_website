title: SiC Trampoline Membrane Resonators for Hybrid Atom-Optomechanics Experiments

event: American Physical Society Division of Atomic and Molecular Physics Meeting

location: Wowchemy HQ

  city: Stanford
  region: CA
  postcode: '94305'
  country: United States

summary: We designed a SiC trampoline membrane resonator (f0 = 290 kHz) with high mechanical quality factor (Q =107) at room temperature for quantum opto-mechanics experiments. Combining a trampoline design with a mechanical low pass filter, we improve the Q factor and suppress the two principal damping mechanisms, Thermo-elastic and Clamping. We present the detailed fabrication process, the experimental characterization of the resonators (spectrum and Q factors), discussion of results, conclusions, future improvements and its perspectives on hybrid-atom quantum opto-mechanics experiments. The fabrication have been done in the Australian National Fabrication Facility, Queensland node, using commercial Si/SiC wafers with a SiC membrane layer of 300 nm and a Si substrate of 500 Âµm. Through standard microfabrication techniques (photolithography, RIE, DRIE and XeFl etching) we release the SiC resonator. We will use these resonators to get a coupling between its fundamental mode cooled to the ground state and the oscillations of CM of cold rubidium atoms in an optical trap to test fundamental physics and applications in precision measurements of gravitational effects.
